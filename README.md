# Fractal Clock

## What is this?

A simple fractal of an analogue clock written in JavaScript. This was inspired by a C++ implementation by [HackerPoet](https://github.com/HackerPoet/FractalClock). A video of this can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SH_-YhN15A). It was felt the fractal would benefit from an online version without having to download it first.

The program has several options that the user can select:

- View/Hide the clock face, fractal branches, fractal ends, and UI.
- Toggle between real time and a reset time.
- Toggle which hands are shown (HM, HMS, MS)
- Toggle between a smaller hour hand and a larger one.
- Toggle whether the colours shift overtime or stay the same.
- Adjust the level of detail of the fractal.



## Possible Extensions

- Include common clock modes, including current time, a timer, and a stopwatch
- Additional digital display, possibly with different layouts
- Mouse/Touchscreen controls

## Todo
- add gradient from root to end
- ?only do fractals on the branch maching the root branch (second arm -> only second arm fractal)?
